Species must evolve to deal with these changes, or become off. Genetic diversity in a population reflects its evolutionary potential. Short -term evolution cannot occur in populations devoid of genetics diversity, while populations with extensive genetics Diversity can evolve relatively quickly in response environmental change. For example, plants with The genetic diversity for heavy metal tolerance was capable of colonizing polluted soils with copper and Cadmium on mines waste in Wales, United Kingdom by evolving tolerant forms. Plant species without the appropriate Genetic diversity has failed to colonize. Likewise, the The American chestnut was used to extinction almost by an introduced disease to which he had no genetics Diversity of resistance. Industrial Melanism has has evolved in about 200 genetically diverse species of Moth in areas subject to industrial pollution. Many \"Harmful\" species have evolved antibiotic resistance and other biocontrasse agents.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Your max_length is set to 256, but you input_length is only 192.
